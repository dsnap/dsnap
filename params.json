It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### Loki: A driver debugging library\r\nLoki is a debugging api which allows you to capture state data from a running Linux driver. This data is kept in a file in the debugfs psuedo-file system. We also provide a python parsing utility for searching and dumping this data into a more easily readable format. The advantages to using debugfs to capture state data are many, but chief among them is the ability to retain and read data about the internal state of a driver even after it has crashed.\r\n\r\nThis project is the work of Team 2.718, a capstone team at Portland State University.
