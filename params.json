The utility takes snapshots of the driver state and allows users to retrieve these snapshots with a user-space tool. This capability gives users invaluable information about the internal state of the driver in the event that the driver crashes while in use, thereby providing a faster, simpler debugging process. This project is the work of Team 2.718, a capstone team at Portland State University."}
