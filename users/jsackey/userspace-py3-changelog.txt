Changes to userspace to get it working with python3:
-Changed any print x to print(x)

-Dealt with byte strings via string.decode('utf-8') (I.e. the magic number in python2 unpacks as 'Loki' and in python3 b'Loki')

-removed ord() from translate function

-imported functools for reduce() (reduce() is a builtin in python2)

-changed xrange() to range() (in python3 range() does what xrange() used to and so xrange() is removed)

-In printItem(), changed elementSize = size/numElements to = int(size/numElements), because float was messing with the data slicing in translate

So far the only testing I've done is to run userspace and userspace-py3 to compare the output.

The only differences are that values change in these 5 items:
